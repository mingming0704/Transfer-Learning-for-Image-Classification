# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification
In this project, we are trying to build a classifier that distinguishes images of six scenes: "buildings", "forest", "glacier", "mountain", "sea", "street".
The pre-trained models used in this project contains: ResNet50, ResNet101, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16.
